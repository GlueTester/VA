Took python file (pytester1.py) from where saved and copied to PATHS
C:\Users\vhalexkingr1\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310
C:\Users\vhalexkingr1\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts
Opened IDEL Shell (think it came with python install) and typed
# Please note this only worked one line at a time for the below command!

```
import py_compile
py_compile.compile('pytester1.py')
```

Output: '__pycache__\\pytester1.cpython-310.pyc'
Went to 
C:\Users\vhalexkingr1\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\__pycache__
and the file "pytester1.cpython-310.pyc" was created
At this point i placed these instruction on github and the dir: __pycache__ was already created
